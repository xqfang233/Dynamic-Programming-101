# Dynamic-Programming-101

This long long article is written for myself, who've been struggling with recursion, backtracking and dynamic programming for a long time. The funny thing is, these three topics are not abstract while terribly obscure(at least for me), so here comes this article.

Most of the examples were cited from http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/. I also attached some related leetcode exercises for practice to deepen my understanding.

"It was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair." The heaven or the other way it was, dynamic programming.
